This is the starter Headless WordPress + [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) used to build sites by [Patronage](https://www.patronage.org). We've previously built nearly a hundred sites using our original [Timber/twig based bubs scaffolding](https://github.com/patronage/bubs), but are favoring headless WordPress now.

Our documentation lives in the docs folder, and can be viewed online:
https://github.com/patronage/bubs-next/tree/main/docs

[Getting Started](https://github.com/patronage/bubs-next/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) is a good place to start if this is your first time using.
